# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
  Skiiers, snowboarders, people that want to meet up and have fun on a mountain
  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
        How do i decide where to go snowboarding today?


  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
        Help users find the best place to ski or snowboard


  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

    1. As a user, I want to open a 'Yay Snow!' web page.

  2. As a user, I want to enter a ski mountain and view the weather report

  3. As a user, I want to enter a ski mountain and view lift ticket prices.

  4. As a user, I want to enter a ski mountain and view a lift status report.

  6. As a user, I want to see the top 3 searched mountains.

 **Nice to haves

 1. twitter feed for each mountain
 2. Display ski mountains near me
 3. Search by lift ticket prices
 

  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
